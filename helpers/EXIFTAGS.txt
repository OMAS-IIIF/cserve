50723	Image	Exif.Image.CameraCalibration1	SRational	CameraCalibration1 defines a calibration matrix that transforms reference camera native space values to individual camera native space values under the first calibration illuminant. The matrix is stored in row scan order. This matrix is stored separately from the matrix specified by the ColorMatrix1 tag to allow raw converters to swap in replacement color matrices based on UniqueCameraModel tag, while still taking advantage of any per-individual camera calibration performed by the camera manufacturer.
50724	Image	Exif.Image.CameraCalibration2	SRational	CameraCalibration2 defines a calibration matrix that transforms reference camera native space values to individual camera native space values under the second calibration illuminant. The matrix is stored in row scan order. This matrix is stored separately from the matrix specified by the ColorMatrix2 tag to allow raw converters to swap in replacement color matrices based on UniqueCameraModel tag, while still taking advantage of any per-individual camera calibration performed by the camera manufacturer.
50725	Image	Exif.Image.ReductionMatrix1	SRational	ReductionMatrix1 defines a dimensionality reduction matrix for use as the first stage in converting color camera native space values to XYZ values, under the first calibration illuminant.

50726	Image	Exif.Image.ReductionMatrix2	SRational	ReductionMatrix2 defines a dimensionality reduction matrix for use as the first stage in converting color camera native space values to XYZ values, under the second calibration illuminant. This tag may only be used if ColorPlanes is greater than 3. The matrix is stored in row scan order.
50727	Image	Exif.Image.AnalogBalance	Rational	"Normally the stored raw values are not white balanced, since any digital white balancing will reduce the dynamic range of the final image if the user decides to later adjust the white balance; however, if camera hardware is capable of white balancing the color channels before the signal is digitized, it can improve the dynamic range of the final image. AnalogBalance defines the gain, either analog (recommended) or digital (not recommended) that has been applied the stored raw values."
50728	Image	Exif.Image.AsShotNeutral	Short	Specifies the selected white balance at time of capture, encoded as the coordinates of a perfectly neutral color in linear reference space values. The inclusion of this tag precludes the inclusion of the AsShotWhiteXY tag.
50729	Image	Exif.Image.AsShotWhiteXY	Rational	Specifies the selected white balance at time of capture, encoded as x-y chromaticity coordinates. The inclusion of this tag precludes the inclusion of the AsShotNeutral tag.
50730	Image	Exif.Image.BaselineExposure	SRational	Camera models vary in the trade-off they make between highlight headroom and shadow noise. Some leave a significant amount of highlight headroom during a normal exposure. This allows significant negative exposure compensation to be applied during raw conversion, but also means normal exposures will contain more shadow noise. Other models leave less headroom during normal exposures. This allows for less negative exposure compensation, but results in lower shadow noise for normal exposures. Because of these differences, a raw converter needs to vary the zero point of its exposure compensation control from model to model. BaselineExposure specifies by how much (in EV units) to move the zero point. Positive values result in brighter default results, while negative values result in darker default results.
50731	Image	Exif.Image.BaselineNoise	Rational	Specifies the relative noise level of the camera model at a baseline ISO value of 100, compared to a reference camera model. Since noise levels tend to vary approximately with the square root of the ISO value, a raw converter can use this value, combined with the current ISO, to estimate the relative noise level of the current image.
50732	Image	Exif.Image.BaselineSharpness	Rational	Specifies the relative amount of sharpening required for this camera model, compared to a reference camera model. Camera models vary in the strengths of their anti-aliasing filters. Cameras with weak or no filters require less sharpening than cameras with strong anti-aliasing filters.
50733	Image	Exif.Image.BayerGreenSplit	Long	Only applies to CFA images using a Bayer pattern filter array. This tag specifies, in arbitrary units, how closely the values of the green pixels in the blue/green rows track the values of the green pixels in the red/green rows. A value of zero means the two kinds of green pixels track closely, while a non-zero value means they sometimes diverge. The useful range for this tag is from 0 (no divergence) to about 5000 (quite large divergence).
50734	Image	Exif.Image.LinearResponseLimit	Rational	Some sensors have an unpredictable non-linearity in their response as they near the upper limit of their encoding range. This non-linearity results in color shifts in the highlight areas of the resulting image unless the raw converter compensates for this effect. LinearResponseLimit specifies the fraction of the encoding range above which the response may become significantly non-linear.
50735	Image	Exif.Image.CameraSerialNumber	Ascii	CameraSerialNumber contains the serial number of the camera or camera body that captured the image.
50736	Image	Exif.Image.LensInfo	Rational	Contains information about the lens that captured the image. If the minimum f-stops are unknown, they should be encoded as 0/0.
50737	Image	Exif.Image.ChromaBlurRadius	Rational	ChromaBlurRadius provides a hint to the DNG reader about how much chroma blur should be applied to the image. If this tag is omitted, the reader will use its default amount of chroma blurring. Normally this tag is only included for non-CFA images, since the amount of chroma blur required for mosaic images is highly dependent on the de-mosaic algorithm, in which case the DNG reader's default value is likely optimized for its particular de-mosaic algorithm.
50738	Image	Exif.Image.AntiAliasStrength	Rational	Provides a hint to the DNG reader about how strong the camera's anti-alias filter is. A value of 0.0 means no anti-alias filter (i.e., the camera is prone to aliasing artifacts with some subjects), while a value of 1.0 means a strong anti-alias filter (i.e., the camera almost never has aliasing artifacts).
50739	Image	Exif.Image.ShadowScale	SRational	This tag is used by Adobe Camera Raw to control the sensitivity of its 'Shadows' slider.
50740	Image	Exif.Image.DNGPrivateData	Byte	Provides a way for camera manufacturers to store private data in the DNG file for use by their own raw converters, and to have that data preserved by programs that edit DNG files.
50741	Image	Exif.Image.MakerNoteSafety	Short	MakerNoteSafety lets the DNG reader know whether the EXIF MakerNote tag is safe to preserve along with the rest of the EXIF data. File browsers and other image management software processing an image with a preserved MakerNote should be aware that any thumbnail image embedded in the MakerNote may be stale, and may not reflect the current state of the full size image.
50778	Image	Exif.Image.CalibrationIlluminant1	Short	The illuminant used for the first set of color calibration tags (ColorMatrix1, CameraCalibration1, ReductionMatrix1). The legal values for this tag are the same as the legal values for the LightSource EXIF tag. If set to 255 (Other), then the IFD must also include a IlluminantData1 tag to specify the x-y chromaticity or spectral power distribution function for this illuminant.
50779	Image	Exif.Image.CalibrationIlluminant2	Short	"The illuminant used for an optional second set of color calibration tags (ColorMatrix2, CameraCalibration2, ReductionMatrix2). The legal values for this tag are the same as the legal values for the CalibrationIlluminant1 tag; however, if both are included, neither is allowed to have a value of 0 (unknown). If set to 255 (Other), then the IFD must also include a IlluminantData2 tag to specify the x-y chromaticity or spectral power distribution function for this illuminant."
50780	Image	Exif.Image.BestQualityScale	Rational	For some cameras, the best possible image quality is not achieved by preserving the total pixel count during conversion. For example, Fujifilm SuperCCD images have maximum detail when their total pixel count is doubled. This tag specifies the amount by which the values of the DefaultScale tag need to be multiplied to achieve the best quality image size.
50781	Image	Exif.Image.RawDataUniqueID	Byte	This tag contains a 16-byte unique identifier for the raw image data in the DNG file. DNG readers can use this tag to recognize a particular raw image, even if the file's name or the metadata contained in the file has been changed. If a DNG writer creates such an identifier, it should do so using an algorithm that will ensure that it is very unlikely two different images will end up having the same identifier.
50827	Image	Exif.Image.OriginalRawFileName	Byte	If the DNG file was converted from a non-DNG raw file, then this tag contains the file name of that original raw file.
50828	Image	Exif.Image.OriginalRawFileData	Undefined	If the DNG file was converted from a non-DNG raw file, then this tag contains the compressed contents of that original raw file. The contents of this tag always use the big-endian byte order. The tag contains a sequence of data blocks. Future versions of the DNG specification may define additional data blocks, so DNG readers should ignore extra bytes when parsing this tag. DNG readers should also detect the case where data blocks are missing from the end of the sequence, and should assume a default value for all the missing blocks. There are no padding or alignment bytes between data blocks.
50829	Image	Exif.Image.ActiveArea	Long	This rectangle defines the active (non-masked) pixels of the sensor. The order of the rectangle coordinates is: top, left, bottom, right.
50830	Image	Exif.Image.MaskedAreas	Long	This tag contains a list of non-overlapping rectangle coordinates of fully masked pixels, which can be optionally used by DNG readers to measure the black encoding level. The order of each rectangle's coordinates is: top, left, bottom, right. If the raw image data has already had its black encoding level subtracted, then this tag should not be used, since the masked pixels are no longer useful.
50831	Image	Exif.Image.AsShotICCProfile	Undefined	This tag contains an ICC profile that, in conjunction with the AsShotPreProfileMatrix tag, provides the camera manufacturer with a way to specify a default color rendering from camera color space coordinates (linear reference values) into the ICC profile connection space. The ICC profile connection space is an output referred colorimetric space, whereas the other color calibration tags in DNG specify a conversion into a scene referred colorimetric space. This means that the rendering in this profile should include any desired tone and gamut mapping needed to convert between scene referred values and output referred values.
50832	Image	Exif.Image.AsShotPreProfileMatrix	SRational	This tag is used in conjunction with the AsShotICCProfile tag. It specifies a matrix that should be applied to the camera color space coordinates before processing the values through the ICC profile specified in the AsShotICCProfile tag. The matrix is stored in the row scan order. If ColorPlanes is greater than three, then this matrix can (but is not required to) reduce the dimensionality of the color data down to three components, in which case the AsShotICCProfile should have three rather than ColorPlanes input components.
50833	Image	Exif.Image.CurrentICCProfile	Undefined	This tag is used in conjunction with the CurrentPreProfileMatrix tag. The CurrentICCProfile and CurrentPreProfileMatrix tags have the same purpose and usage as the AsShotICCProfile and AsShotPreProfileMatrix tag pair, except they are for use by raw file editors rather than camera manufacturers.
50834	Image	Exif.Image.CurrentPreProfileMatrix	SRational	This tag is used in conjunction with the CurrentICCProfile tag. The CurrentICCProfile and CurrentPreProfileMatrix tags have the same purpose and usage as the AsShotICCProfile and AsShotPreProfileMatrix tag pair, except they are for use by raw file editors rather than camera manufacturers.
50879	Image	Exif.Image.ColorimetricReference	Short	The DNG color model documents a transform between camera colors and CIE XYZ values. This tag describes the colorimetric reference for the CIE XYZ values. 0 = The XYZ values are scene-referred. 1 = The XYZ values are output-referred, using the ICC profile perceptual dynamic range. This tag allows output-referred data to be stored in DNG files and still processed correctly by DNG readers.
50931	Image	Exif.Image.CameraCalibrationSignature	Byte	A UTF-8 encoded string associated with the CameraCalibration1 and CameraCalibration2 tags. The CameraCalibration1 and CameraCalibration2 tags should only be used in the DNG color transform if the string stored in the CameraCalibrationSignature tag exactly matches the string stored in the ProfileCalibrationSignature tag for the selected camera profile.
50932	Image	Exif.Image.ProfileCalibrationSignature	Byte	A UTF-8 encoded string associated with the camera profile tags. The CameraCalibration1 and CameraCalibration2 tags should only be used in the DNG color transfer if the string stored in the CameraCalibrationSignature tag exactly matches the string stored in the ProfileCalibrationSignature tag for the selected camera profile.
50933	Image	Exif.Image.ExtraCameraProfiles	Long	A list of file offsets to extra Camera Profile IFDs. Note that the primary camera profile tags should be stored in IFD 0, and the ExtraCameraProfiles tag should only be used if there is more than one camera profile stored in the DNG file.
50934	Image	Exif.Image.AsShotProfileName	Byte	"A UTF-8 encoded string containing the name of the ""as shot"" camera profile, if any."
50935	Image	Exif.Image.NoiseReductionApplied	Rational	"This tag indicates how much noise reduction has been applied to the raw data on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0. A 0.0 value indicates that no noise reduction has been applied. A 1.0 value indicates that the ""ideal"" amount of noise reduction has been applied, i.e. that the DNG reader should not apply additional noise reduction by default. A value of 0/0 indicates that this parameter is unknown."
50936	Image	Exif.Image.ProfileName	Byte	A UTF-8 encoded string containing the name of the camera profile. This tag is optional if there is only a single camera profile stored in the file but is required for all camera profiles if there is more than one camera profile stored in the file.
50937	Image	Exif.Image.ProfileHueSatMapDims	Long	This tag specifies the number of input samples in each dimension of the hue/saturation/value mapping tables. The data for these tables are stored in ProfileHueSatMapData1, ProfileHueSatMapData2 and ProfileHueSatMapData3 tags. The most common case has ValueDivisions equal to 1, so only hue and saturation are used as inputs to the mapping table.
50938	Image	Exif.Image.ProfileHueSatMapData1	Float	"This tag contains the data for the first hue/saturation/value mapping table. Each entry of the table contains three 32-bit IEEE floating-point values. The first entry is hue shift in degrees; the second entry is saturation scale factor; and the third entry is a value scale factor. The table entries are stored in the tag in nested loop order, with the value divisions in the outer loop, the hue divisions in the middle loop, and the saturation divisions in the inner loop. All zero input saturation entries are required to have a value scale factor of 1.0."
50939	Image	Exif.Image.ProfileHueSatMapData2	Float	"This tag contains the data for the second hue/saturation/value mapping table. Each entry of the table contains three 32-bit IEEE floating-point values. The first entry is hue shift in degrees; the second entry is a saturation scale factor; and the third entry is a value scale factor. The table entries are stored in the tag in nested loop order, with the value divisions in the outer loop, the hue divisions in the middle loop, and the saturation divisions in the inner loop. All zero input saturation entries are required to have a value scale factor of 1.0."
50940	Image	Exif.Image.ProfileToneCurve	Float	This tag contains a default tone curve that can be applied while processing the image as a starting point for user adjustments. The curve is specified as a list of 32-bit IEEE floating-point value pairs in linear gamma. Each sample has an input value in the range of 0.0 to 1.0, and an output value in the range of 0.0 to 1.0. The first sample is required to be (0.0, 0.0), and the last sample is required to be (1.0, 1.0). Interpolated the curve using a cubic spline.
50941	Image	Exif.Image.ProfileEmbedPolicy	Long	This tag contains information about the usage rules for the associated camera profile.
50942	Image	Exif.Image.ProfileCopyright	Byte	A UTF-8 encoded string containing the copyright information for the camera profile. This string always should be preserved along with the other camera profile tags.

50970	Image	Exif.Image.PreviewColorSpace	Long	This tag specifies the color space in which the rendered preview in this IFD is stored. The default value for this tag is sRGB for color previews and Gray Gamma 2.2 for monochrome previews.
50971	Image	Exif.Image.PreviewDateTime	Ascii	This tag is an ASCII string containing the name of the date/time at which the preview stored in the IFD was rendered. The date/time is encoded using ISO 8601 format.
50972	Image	Exif.Image.RawImageDigest	Undefined	This tag is an MD5 digest of the raw image data. All pixels in the image are processed in row-scan order. Each pixel is zero padded to 16 or 32 bits deep (16-bit for data less than or equal to 16 bits deep, 32-bit otherwise). The data for each pixel is processed in little-endian byte order.
50973	Image	Exif.Image.OriginalRawFileDigest	Undefined	This tag is an MD5 digest of the data stored in the OriginalRawFileData tag.
50974	Image	Exif.Image.SubTileBlockSize	Long	Normally, the pixels within a tile are stored in simple row-scan order. This tag specifies that the pixels within a tile should be grouped first into rectangular blocks of the specified size. These blocks are stored in row-scan order. Within each block, the pixels are stored in row-scan order. The use of a non-default value for this tag requires setting the DNGBackwardVersion tag to at least 1.2.0.0.
50975	Image	Exif.Image.RowInterleaveFactor	Long	This tag specifies that rows of the image are stored in interleaved order. The value of the tag specifies the number of interleaved fields. The use of a non-default value for this tag requires setting the DNGBackwardVersion tag to at least 1.2.0.0.
50981	Image	Exif.Image.ProfileLookTableDims	Long	"This tag specifies the number of input samples in each dimension of a default ""look"" table. The data for this table is stored in the ProfileLookTableData tag."
50982	Image	Exif.Image.ProfileLookTableData	Float	"This tag contains a default ""look"" table that can be applied while processing the image as a starting point for user adjustment. This table uses the same format as the tables stored in the ProfileHueSatMapData1 and ProfileHueSatMapData2 tags, and is applied in the same color space. However, it should be applied later in the processing pipe, after any exposure compensation and/or fill light stages, but before any tone curve stage. Each entry of the table contains three 32-bit IEEE floating-point values. The first entry is hue shift in degrees, the second entry is a saturation scale factor, and the third entry is a value scale factor. The table entries are stored in the tag in nested loop order, with the value divisions in the outer loop, the hue divisions in the middle loop, and the saturation divisions in the inner loop. All zero input saturation entries are required to have a value scale factor of 1.0."

51041	Image	Exif.Image.NoiseProfile	Double	NoiseProfile describes the amount of noise in a raw image. Specifically, this tag models the amount of signal-dependent photon (shot) noise and signal-independent sensor readout noise, two common sources of noise in raw images. The model assumes that the noise is white and spatially independent, ignoring fixed pattern effects and other sources of noise (e.g., pixel response non-uniformity, spatially-dependent thermal effects, etc.).
51043	Image	Exif.Image.TimeCodes	Byte	The optional TimeCodes tag shall contain an ordered array of time codes. All time codes shall be 8 bytes long and in binary format. The tag may contain from 1 to 10 time codes. When the tag contains more than one time code, the first one shall be the default time code. This specification does not prescribe how to use multiple time codes. Each time code shall be as defined for the 8-byte time code structure in SMPTE 331M-2004, Section 8.3. See also SMPTE 12-1-2008 and SMPTE 309-1999.
51044	Image	Exif.Image.FrameRate	SRational	The optional FrameRate tag shall specify the video frame rate in number of image frames per second, expressed as a signed rational number. The numerator shall be non-negative and the denominator shall be positive. This field value is identical to the sample rate field in SMPTE 377-1-2009.
51058	Image	Exif.Image.TStop	SRational	The optional TStop tag shall specify the T-stop of the actual lens, expressed as an unsigned rational number. T-stop is also known as T-number or the photometric aperture of the lens. (F-number is the geometric aperture of the lens.)

51108	Image	Exif.Image.ProfileLookTableEncoding	Long	Provides a way for color profiles to specify how indexing into a 3D LookTable is performed during raw conversion. This tag is not applicable to a 2.5D LookTable (i.e., where the Value dimension is 1).
51109	Image	Exif.Image.BaselineExposureOffset	SRational	Provides a way for color profiles to increase or decrease exposure during raw conversion. BaselineExposureOffset specifies the amount (in EV units) to add to the BaselineExposure tag during image rendering. For example, if the BaselineExposure value for a given camera model is +0.3, and the BaselineExposureOffset value for a given camera profile used to render an image for that camera model is -0.7, then the actual default exposure value used during rendering will be +0.3 - 0.7 = -0.4.
51110	Image	Exif.Image.DefaultBlackRender	Long	This optional tag in a color profile provides a hint to the raw converter regarding how to handle the black point (e.g., flare subtraction) during rendering. If set to Auto, the raw converter should perform black subtraction during rendering. If set to None, the raw converter should not perform any black subtraction during rendering.

51177	Image	Exif.Image.DepthFormat	Short	Specifies the encoding of any depth data in the file. Can be unknown (apart from nearer distances being closer to zero, and farther distances being closer to the maximum value), linear (values vary linearly from zero representing DepthNear to the maximum value representing DepthFar), or inverse (values are stored inverse linearly, with zero representing DepthNear and the maximum value representing DepthFar).
51178	Image	Exif.Image.DepthNear	Rational	Specifies distance from the camera represented by the zero value in the depth map. 0/0 means unknown.
51179	Image	Exif.Image.DepthFar	Rational	Specifies distance from the camera represented by the maximum value in the depth map. 0/0 means unknown. 1/0 means infinity, which is valid for unknown and inverse depth formats.
